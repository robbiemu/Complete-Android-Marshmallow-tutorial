# The assets folder

The assets folder can be used to store raw media and data:

* audio (wav, mp3, midi)
* fonts
* images
* text
* non-android xml

This stands in contrast to data put in the main/res folder, which is done via a gui and converted to the android standards of presentation (images are resized, for example).
