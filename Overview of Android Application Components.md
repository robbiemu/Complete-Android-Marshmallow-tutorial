## Overview of Service, BroadCast Receivers, Intents, Activity and Content Provider lesson

Major applications are generally made of several components:

* Activity - a page displayed to the user for interaction.
* Intent - provides the ability to go from one page to another, one app to another, etc. 
* Service - background apps that act independently of the user, commonly used to add notifications
* Broadcast Receiver - this is a special object in android that listens for system service request, which commonly can trigger notifications, system modal dialogs, etc
* Content Provider - 

### Intents

An intent specifies a service to call (for a given intent tag) from the broadcast receiver.

There are two types of intents: _explicit intents_ and _implicit intents_.
