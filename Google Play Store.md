## Publishing and Updating App in Google PlayStore

### Registering at Google Play Store

Developer's must pay a one time fee of $25 to register an account to publish content to google play. This is done at the "Google Play Developer Console". After this, you can publish your apps at the developer console.

### Publishing an app

For each app, you should generate a keystore to sign your app with. This creates an encrypted key to modify your app. Versions or variants (beta, vs release, etc) can be managed with their own passwords within the keystore using key aliases. Create the keystore for your app, and create at least one alias for it.

Now build the signed APK.

You can then publish your app by uploading the apk. At first, you might prefer to publish it as an alpha version.

You will need to create a screenshot, a > 1200x500 features image, and a 512x512 app icon image.
